Super mario boulder dash game can be played by using arrow key in key board or auto played by artificial intelligence.

The GUI is implemented by javax.swing.

The AI using brute force to check all possible game states, give each state a utility value and choose the move leading to highest utility.

The utility is estimated by the win lose abort state, the coin already got, the distance to the potentially available closest coin and whether rock is blocking the coin or exit.

1. How to run:

Double click SuperMarioBoulderDash.jar it will run contest10.map with AI.

Or use command to specify map and the way to play:

Java -jar SuperMarioBoulderDash.jar contest10.map ExhaustiveMiner

The map name "contest10.map" can be replaced by following 20 maps (case sensitive):

contest1.map
contest2.map
...
contest10.map
lightning1.map
lightning2.map
...
lightning10.map

The play mode "ExhaustiveMiner" can be replaced by following 4 ways (case sensitive):

ArrowMiner (User can use arrow key on the keyboard to control the Super Mario.)
ExhaustiveMiner (The artificial intelligence to play game by brute force 5 steps further.)
RandomWalk (Auto play by random moves.)
DefaultMiner (Play by type in instruction character to console: A (abort), U (up), D (down), L (left), R (right), and W (wait).)

2. How to compile:

CD src
Javac *.java
Java Lift

Make sure "Maps" and "resources" folder are in the same path with class files.

Problem idea comes from:
ICFP Programming Contest 2012 Lambda Lifting

The rule changed a little for rationality:
Dillon's rule: Miner can keep going down as the same speed with the falling rock above his head.
